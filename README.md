Saucedemo Automation Project Guide

This project is built using Java, Gradle, JUnit, and follows the Page Object Model pattern. It supports environment-based configuration and can run locally or in CI/CD pipelines.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure the following are installed:

Java 11 or later
Gradle 7 or later (or use the Gradle wrapper ./gradlew)
Chrome installed (for UI tests)
Environment Configuration

Each test environment has its own configuration file under src/test/resources/config/. The file format is:

config-default.properties
config-qa.properties
Each file can define properties like:

Running the Tests

To run the tests, use Gradle with an optional environment parameter.

Run with default environment (config-default.properties):
./gradlew test
Run with QA environment (config-qa.properties):
./gradlew test -Denv=qa
The env parameter is passed as a system property and is used by the ConfigManager to load the correct config file.

üîÅ Parallel Execution (Optional)

If possible, enable parallel test execution by adding the following in src/test/resources/junit-platform.properties:

junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true
This speeds up execution when tests are independent.

Reports

After running the tests, reports are generated by default in:

build/reports/tests/test/index.html
